= A Haskell Project with Free Monads

This project demonstrates the use of Free Monads in Haskell, providing a simple key-value store as an example.

== Key Features

- **Free Monads**: The project utilizes Free Monads to separate the description of computations from their execution.
- **Key-Value Store**: A simple in-memory key-value store is implemented as an example use case.
- **Interpreters**: Multiple interpreters are provided to run the key-value store, including an in-memory version and a logging version.

== Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and use `stack` to build and run the examples.

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/F-Joachim/free-monads.git
cd free-monads
stack build
stack exec free-monads-exe
----

=== Using Nix Flake
If you prefer using Nix, you can use the provided `flake.nix` to set up the environment:

[source, bash]
----
nix develop
stack build
stack exec free-monads-exe
